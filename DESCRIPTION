Description: Frequent Item Set Mining (FIM) and Association Rule
  Induction are among the best known and most popular data mining
  methods. Originally developed for market basket analysis, they
  are used nowadays for almost any task that requires discovering
  regularities between (nominal) variables. This package contains
  implementations of various frequent item set mining and association
  rule induction algorithms, including Apriori, Eclat, FP-growth,
  SaM, RElim, Carpenter and IsTa. In addition, it offers functionality
  for pattern spectrum filtering (PSF) and pattern set reduction (PSR),
  which aim at filtering out statistically significant patterns as
  well as removing induced spurious patterns.
